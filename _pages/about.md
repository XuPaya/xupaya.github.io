## About Me
I am a 3rd year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine, advised by [Prof. Shuang Zhao](https://www.shuangz.com/). I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2022, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Pedro V. Sander](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~psander/), as well as working remotely with [Prof. Tzu-Mao Li](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tzli/).

My research interests are in the areas of computer graphics, specifically in the field of physically-based rendering and differentiable rendering. The goal of my research is to improve the efficiency and robustness of rendering/differentiable rendering, and explore new applications of differentiable rendering. My past research experiences include developing a path-space warped-area reparameterization method for differentiable path tracing, and a Langevin Monte Carlo method for sampling discontinuities in differentiable rendering.
