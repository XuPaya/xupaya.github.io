## About Me
I am a 2nd year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine, advised by [Prof. Shuang Zhao](https://www.shuangz.com/). My research interests are in the areas of computer graphics, specifically in the field of physically-based rendering and differentiable rendering. I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2022, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Pedro V. Sander](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~psander/).
