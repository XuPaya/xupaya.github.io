We introduce a new mathematical formulation that enjoys the benefits of both classes of methods. Unlike previous reparameterization work that focused on hemispherical integral, we derive the reparameterization in the path space. As a result, to estimate derivatives using our formulation, we can apply advanced Monte Carlo rendering methods, such as bidirectional path tracing, while avoiding explicit sampling of discontinuity boundaries. We show differentiable rendering and inverse rendering results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
